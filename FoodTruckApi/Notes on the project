We use babel in order to be able to use ES6 type 
of Java script (it translate ES6 to ES5). So we need two folder inside the project folder
one called dist (for distribution) where the
converted JS goes and one called src where the js to be converted 
goes. 
This will be reflected in the package.json file

We install two different dependencies:
- regular that we install with --save flag
- dev that we install with --save-dev flag

We installed eslint in order for it to check that the file is correct

we define the scripts in npm to build and run the applications



the Following packages are needed for authentication 

npm install --save express-jwt # json wet token
                    jsonwebtocken passport 
                   passport-local passport-local-mongoose

We first register then we login and once you loging it send back a jason wet tocken
and use this token to authorize the api calls
